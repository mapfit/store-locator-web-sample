# Store Locator Sample Project
This sample project is made to demonstrate the usage of [Mapfit JS](https://mapfit.com/developers/javascript). In the project, 10 addresses are listed and drawn on the map.

## What is included?
- Changing the zoom level and center position.
- Placing an address with an entrance marker and building polygon. This feature uses the Mapfit Geocoder API internally.
- Listening to marker click events.
- Scrollable list view that corresponds with markers using event listeners.

## Requirements
You will need to obtain Mapfit API key to run the project. You can get it [here](https://dash.mapfit.com/admin/signup).
